    "Note that $\\text{SO}(3)$ is a matrix Lie group that describes the orientation of rigid body in 3D space and is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^3$. However, because Lie groups are smooth (i.e., differentiable) manifolds, there is an atlas of charts (i.e., homemorphisms) that allow the manifold to be locally described as a Euclidean space. A popular set of local parameterizations are the intuitive Euler angles, of which there are twelve. We will use the 3-2-1 ($\\psi$-$\\theta$-$\\phi$) Euler angle representation as is common in aerospace with first a yaw rotation about $\\mathbf{k}$, a pitch rotation about $\\mathbf{j}$, and then a roll rotation about $\\mathbf{i}$. Additionally, we assume that the roll, pitch, and yaw of the quadrotor are small -- a logical assumption for the smooth trajectories of typical maneuvers. More precisely, we have that\n",
