    "In many control schemes that follow trajectories, higher order derivatives are often needed. This section discusses an implementation of a digital derivative based in Laplace system theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from system theory that the Laplace transform is a useful way of analyzing linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. It takes time-domain systems and expresses them in the Laplace domain (a superset of the Fourier frequency domain). The unilateral Laplace transform is defined by\n",

    "where $t$ is a time variable and $s$ is the Laplace variable. This transform can be thought as projecting a time-domain function onto exponentials of varying phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transform is particularly useful when analyzing LTI systems of differential equations. In particular, the Laplace transform of the time-derivative of a continuous system $f(t)$ can be found to be\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, differentiation in the time-domain corresponds to multiplication by $s$ in the Laplace domain. Although a pure derivative in the Laplace domain is causal, it is not realizable (i.e., can you build an RLC circuit that realizes $F(s)=s$?). Therefore, a band-limited derivative (i.e., a *dirty derivative*) is used:\n",

    "From this discussion, we can see that the dirty derivative \\eqref{eq:dirty-derivative} can be thought of as a filtered version of a pure derivative with bandwidth $1/\\tau$. This is useful as the LPF will prevent the derivative operator from picking up high-frequency components of the input signal and amplifying noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common value of $\\tau$ is $0.5$ ($20$ Hz). A higher $\\tau$ corresponds to less bandwidth and more rejection of high-frequency components, which results in a smoother output.\n",
